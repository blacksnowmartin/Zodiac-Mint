Before Running:

Get a Thirdweb API Key:
Go to the Thirdweb Dashboard.
Create a new API key.
Copy the Client ID.
Replace "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" in the code with your actual Client ID. Important: Keep your API keys secure. For production apps, consider restricting the key's allowed domains.
Deploy an NFT Collection Contract:
Go to the Thirdweb Explore page or your dashboard.
Click "Deploy Now" on the "NFT Collection" contract.
Configure your contract (give it a name like "Zodiac Signs", a symbol like "ZDC").
Choose the Avalanche Fuji Testnet as the network.
Deploy the contract (you'll need some testnet AVAX in your wallet for gas fees - get some from the Avalanche Faucet).
Once deployed, copy the Contract Address.
Replace "YOUR_NFT_COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" in the code with your deployed contract address.
Get a Web3 Wallet: You need a browser wallet like MetaMask installed and configured for the Avalanche Fuji Testnet.
Get Testnet AVAX: Use the Avalanche Faucet to get some Fuji AVAX for gas fees required to mint the NFT.
How to Use:

Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., zodiac_mint.html).
Open the HTML file in your web browser.
Click "Connect Wallet" and approve the connection in your wallet (make sure it's set to Avalanche Fuji Testnet).
Once connected, select your birth date using the date picker.
Click the "Mint Zodiac NFT" button.
Approve the transaction in your wallet (this will cost a small amount of testnet AVAX for gas).
If successful, you'll see a confirmation message, the transaction hash (linking to the Snowtrace block explorer), and details of your minted Zodiac NFT.
This example provides a fundamental structure. You could expand this by:

Generating more sophisticated and unique SVG images for each sign/mint.
Integrating a proper astrology library to calculate more detailed chart aspects.
Adding features to view the entire collection or trade NFTs.
Improving the UI/UX design.
Deploying to the Avalanche Mainnet.
